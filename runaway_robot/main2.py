# ----------
# Part Two
#
# Now we'll make the scenario a bit more realistic. Now Traxbot's
# sensor measurements are a bit noisy (though its motions are still
# completetly noise-free and it still moves in an almost-circle).
# You'll have to write a function that takes as input the next
# noisy (x, y) sensor measurement and outputs the best guess
# for the robot's next position.
#
# ----------
# YOUR JOB
#
# Complete the function estimate_next_pos. You will be considered
# correct if your estimate is within 0.01 stepsizes of Traxbot's next
# true position.
#
# ----------
# GRADING
#
# We will make repeated calls to your estimate_next_pos function. After
# each call, we will compare your estimated position to the robot's true
# position. As soon as you are within 0.01 stepsizes of the true position,
# you will be marked correct and we will tell you how many steps it took
# before your function successfully located the target bot.

# These import steps give you access to libraries which you may (or may
# not) want to use.
